			<h1>Who are we?</h1>
			<p>We are three students from Roc ter aa, in Helmond. This is our exam group project, 
				this means we have to work together as students to create a working product(without the help of any teachers). 
				The idea was <q>to help the tourists with planning their trip by plane</q>. 
				To achieve this we had multiple ideas we wanted to produce: by scanning their tickets(imagine it like a terminal on the airport), 
				it would link the city of the airport will also find some news articles intersting to your destination and also showing news articles about tourismand such.
